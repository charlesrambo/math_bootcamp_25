**Assignments and Grading Policy:**

There will be three homework assignments, each worth 33% of your final grade. You must receive an average score of at least 65% to pass the course. One additional make-up assignment will be available for students who missed a homework or whose overall score is too low. The assignments will be posted on the instructor's GitHub repository. Submit your solutions via email. Collaboration is allowed, but each team can only submit one solution with all team members' names listed. Teams cannot have more than four people. The course is graded Pass/Fail. No letter grades will be given.
